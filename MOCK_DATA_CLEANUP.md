# Mock Data Cleanup Summary

## Overview
All mock/fake data has been removed from the KPC system and replaced with real API data connections.

## Files Updated

### 1. Dashboard Main Page (`/dashboard/page.tsx`)
**Before**: Hardcoded metrics and data
- Fixed revenue: MWK 45,231.89
- Fixed profit: MWK 18,092.76
- Hardcoded stock alerts
- Static profit/loss summary

**After**: Real API data
- Fetches from `/api/dashboard/metrics`
- Fetches from `/api/inventory/low-stock`
- Fetches from `/api/reports/profit-loss`
- Dynamic calculations and displays
- Proper loading states and error handling

### 2. Reports Page (`/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`)
**Before**: Extensive fallback mock data
- Sample profit/loss data
- Fake sales records
- Mock product data
- Hardcoded metrics

**After**: Clean API integration
- Removed all fallback mock data
- Shows empty states when no data available
- Proper error handling without fake data
- Real-time data from multiple APIs

### 3. Settings Page (`/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`)
**Before**: Hardcoded default values
- "My Business" as business name
- "john@example.com" as email
- Fixed addresses and phone numbers

**After**: Dynamic data loading
- Loads real user profile data
- Loads actual business settings
- Empty defaults that get populated from APIs
- Proper save functionality for both profile and business data

## New APIs Created

### 1. User Profile API (`/api/user/profile/route.ts`)
- GET: Fetch user profile information
- PUT: Update user profile data
- Proper validation and error handling

### 2. Enhanced Settings API
- Already existed but now properly integrated
- Handles business settings and VAT configuration

## Data Flow Changes

### Before
```
Component → Hardcoded Data → Display
```

### After
```
Component → API Call → Real Database Data → Display
Component → Loading State → Error Handling → Empty States
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Accurate Data**: All displays now show real business data
2. **Proper States**: Loading, error, and empty states implemented
3. **Real-time Updates**: Data reflects actual business operations
4. **No Confusion**: No more mixing of fake and real data
5. **Professional**: System ready for production use

## Empty State Handling

When no data is available, the system now shows:
- Informative empty state messages
- Helpful icons and descriptions
- Guidance on how to populate data
- Professional appearance

## Error Handling

All API calls now include:
- Proper error catching
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation
- No fallback to fake data

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Fresh Database**: Test with empty database to see empty states
2. **Add Real Data**: Create actual products, sales, expenses
3. **Verify Calculations**: Ensure all metrics calculate correctly
4. **Check Responsiveness**: Verify loading states work properly

## Migration Notes

- Existing users will see empty data initially if they haven't used the APIs
- All new data entry will populate the real system
- No data migration needed as mock data was only in frontend
- Settings will need to be configured by users

This cleanup ensures the KPC system is production-ready with real data integration throughout.
