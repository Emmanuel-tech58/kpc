Version: 1.0 (User-focused)
Date: 2025-11-02

Welcome
-------
This quick user guide explains how to use the KPC web app to manage shops, inventory, and sales. It's written for end-users (store managers, cashiers, or administrators) — no developer knowledge required.

How to sign in
--------------
- Open your browser to the app URL (for local installs: http://localhost:3000).
- If the app requires authentication, enter your username/email and password. If you don't have an account, contact your administrator.

Main navigation
---------------
- Dashboard: Overall business overview and quick actions.
- Inventory: View and manage products, stock levels and categories.
- Sales: Create new sales (checkout) and view past transactions.
- Shops: Manage your physical locations (view, add, edit).
- Customers: View and add customer records.
- Users & Roles: (Admins only) Manage users and access levels.

Dashboard overview
------------------
The dashboard shows high level metrics:
- Total Revenue: Money collected during the selected period.
- Sales Count: Number of transactions.
- Products in Stock: Total products available across the shop.
- Low Stock Items: Items that need restocking.

Shops — Manage locations
------------------------
Location: Dashboard > Shops

View shops:
- The Shops page lists each location with address and contact info.
- Click the eye (View) icon to open the Shop Dashboard for details about that location.

Add a shop:
- Click "Add Shop".
- Fill in the shop name, address, phone, email and business association.
- Save — the shop appears in the list.

Edit a shop:
- Click the Edit (pencil) icon on a shop card.
- Update fields, then save.

Deactivate / Delete a shop:
- Click Delete (trash). If a shop has related sales or inventory the app will typically deactivate it instead of hard-deleting.

Shop Dashboard (per location)
----------------------------
Location: Dashboard > Shops > View (eye) a shop

This view shows:
- Shop header: name, address, contact and Active/Inactive status.
- Metrics cards: Revenue, Sales, Products in Stock, Low Stock Items.
- Recent Sales: A short list of latest transactions at that shop.
- Inventory Overview: Recently updated inventory items and their quantities.

Inventory — Products & Stock
---------------------------
View products:
- Go to Dashboard > Inventory to see the product list.
- Use filters (category, supplier, stock status) to narrow the list.

Add a product:
- Click "Add Product" (or similar) and enter product name, SKU, price, and minimum stock.
- Assign it to a shop or multiple shops if applicable.

Update stock:
- Use the stock movement dialog to increase or decrease quantities.
- For quick adjustments, open a product and edit its available quantity.

Sales — Creating a sale (cashier flow)
------------------------------------
1. Go to Dashboard > Sales > New Sale.
2. Select the shop where the sale is happening.
3. Search and add products to the sale.
   - When changing the quantity, type the desired number in the quantity input. (If you see a persistent digit like "1" that you can't remove, click inside and replace the whole value — if behavior persists, report the issue to your admin.)
4. Add customer information (optional) and payment details.
5. Click "Complete Sale" or "Checkout" — a receipt will be generated.

Customers
---------
- Add customer details (name, phone, email) to keep records of buyers.
- Use customers when creating sales to track purchase history.

Users & Roles (administrators)
------------------------------
- Admins can add users, assign roles and control access to parts of the app.
- Roles allow grouping permissions (e.g., cashier, manager).

Reports
-------
- Visit Reports or Dashboard sections to view graphs and summaries for revenue, sales, and inventory.
- Select a period (day/week/month) and shop to filter data.

Common issues & quick fixes
--------------------------
I can't sign in:
- Ensure your username/email and password are correct. Ask the administrator to reset your password if needed.

The View (eye) button doesn't open a shop:
- Try refreshing the page. If the problem persists, contact support with the shop name and the date/time you clicked.

Quantity input shows an extra digit (e.g. typing 7 yields 17):
- Click inside the quantity field and replace the whole value (select all and type the new number).
- If the issue persists, report the bug to your administrator and include the product name and the steps you took.

I see a "site error" or data missing:
- Refresh the page and try again.
- If that doesn't help, capture the error message and contact your administrator.

Where to get help
-----------------
- Contact your system administrator or the person who installed KPC for your business.
- When reporting an issue, include:
  - What you did (steps to reproduce)
  - What happened (error messages, screenshots)
  - Which shop / product / user was involved

Final notes
-----------
- This guide covers common user tasks. If you want, I can create a printable Word/PDF version with screenshots for training.
- If you'd like me to add step-by-step screenshots for the Sales flow or Shop Dashboard, tell me which screens to capture and I'll prepare a ready-to-paste document.
